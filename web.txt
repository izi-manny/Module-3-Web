The Web consists of public pages which are accessible through the internet. The internet is an interconnected network of computers that are linked by a router and miles of fiber optic cables cables or satellites. In order to access the Web, a "client" computer sends a request, usually via a Web browser, to a "server" computer, which runs continuously waiting for messages and in turn sends back a response.The communication between clients and servers is defined by a protocol referred to as HTTP. 

Each computer has a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address denoted by four numbers and separated by a dot. Since humans have a difficult time remembering these series of numbers, a DNS, Domain Name Service, is used instead. So when a URL link is clicked, the DNS matches a web address (or domain name) to the website's actual IP address.

Once the server accepts an HTTP requests, it sends a response back to the client with the component files. These files include code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, along with any associated asset files such as images or videos. These files are sent in "packets", which are small chunks of data. When the client browser receives these packets, it assembles them together and renders the complete webpage using its engine.
